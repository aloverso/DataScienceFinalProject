  <summary>5/17/2005--Introduced.
Constitutional Protection of the Right to Vote Act - Provides that the right of a citizen to vote shall not be denied or abridged because that citizen has been convicted of a criminal offense, unless such citizen is, at the time of the vote, serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility or is otherwise under the supervision or actual or constructive custody of a governmental authority pursuant to that conviction.

Requires each correctional institution or facility to establish and carry out a system of notice to ensure that persons being released from that institution or facility are informed of the right to vote protected by this Act.</summary>
