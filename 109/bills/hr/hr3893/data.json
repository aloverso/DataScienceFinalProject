    "text": "Gasoline for America's Security Act of 2005 - Sets forth a statutory framework in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to: (1) increase refinery capacity for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel; (2) reduce environmental and other regulations affecting refineries under the Clean Air Act; and (3) coordinate permitting requirements and other regulations affecting refineries at the federal, state, and local levels.\n\nTitle I: Increasing Refinery Capacity - (Sec. 101) Prescribes guidelines for federal-state regulatory coordination between a state Governor, the Secretary of Energy (Secretary), and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Administrator), including financial, technical and legal assistance, in order to facilitate refinery siting, construction, expansion, or operation.\n\nInstructs the President to designate sites on federal lands for siting of a refinery, including at least three military installations closed or approved for closure. Requires real property at such military installations, even those found suitable for refinery siting, to be managed and disposed of in the manner provided by the applicable base closure law.\n\n(Sec. 102) Designates the Department of Energy (DOE) as the lead agency for coordinating all federal refinery authorizations and related environmental reviews.\n\nRequires federal and state agencies or officials to cooperate with the Secretary and comply with deadlines.\n\nInstructs the Secretary to establish a federal refinery authorization schedule.\n\n(Sec. 103) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal refinery revitalization guidelines governing federal-state regulatory coordination and assistance.\n\n(Sec. 104) Authorizes the Secretary to contract with certain non-federal entities to construct new refineries in the United States or refurbish and return to commercial operation existing but nonoperating refineries.\n\nEstablishes in the Treasury the Standby Refinery Support Account to cover specified costs of new or refurbished refinery operations.
