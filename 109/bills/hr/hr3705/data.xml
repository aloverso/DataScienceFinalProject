  <summary>9/8/2005--Introduced.
Protection Against Gouging Activities Act - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit price gouging during a period of national emergency. Defines: (1) "price gouging" as selling or renting any product, service, dwelling, or facility at a price that grossly exceeds the average price at which it was obtainable in the same area during the 30-day period immediately proceeding the national emergency, where the increase is not attributable to any reasonable attendant business risk resulting from the emergency or is not consistent with market trends; and (2) "period of national emergency" as the 90 days immediately following the declaration of an emergency or major disaster.</summary>
