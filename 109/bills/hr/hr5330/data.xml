Express Carrier Employee Protection Act - Amends the Railway Labor Act to provide coverage under such Act to express carrier employees only if they are licensed airmen, licensed aircraft maintenance technicians, or licensed aircraft dispatchers, and only if they perform duties pursuant to the privileges of an appropriate license.

Declares that all other express carrier employees shall be covered by the National Labor Relations Act.

Defines express carriers as companies (including affiliates under common control or ownership) that have an integrated network of air and surface transportation for express shipment of packages.</summary>
