  <summary>7/12/2005--Introduced.
Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station Relicensing Act of 2005 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to condition relicensing of nuclear facilities upon an evaluation of: (1) health risks, vulnerability to terrorist attack, evacuation plans, surrounding population increases, ability to store nuclear waste, and safety and security record of the facility; and (2) the impact of a nuclear accident at the facility.

Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from relicensing the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station until it has considered a report to Congress by the National Academy of Sciences that provides: (1) an independent assessment of safety performance; and (2) recommendations whether the Station should be relicensed and the conditions for such relicensing.</summary>
