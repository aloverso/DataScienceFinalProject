Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to increase from $250 million to $500 million the maximum size of a small insured depository institution which the appropriate federal banking agency may subject to a full-scope, on-site examination every 18 months (instead of every 12 months), if the greater amount would be consistent with the principles of institution safety and soundness.</summary>
