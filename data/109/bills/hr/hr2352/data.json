(Currently, a label that characterizes the relationship of any nutrient to a disease or health-related condition is deemed to be misbranded.)\n\nProvides that a claim or a truthful and not misleading statement on the label or in the labeling of a food or dietary supplement shall not cause the food or dietary supplement to be a drug."
