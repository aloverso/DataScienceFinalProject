Requires public disclosure of such flights.\n\nAmends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to exclude from the definition of contribution any travel expense for a flight on such aircraft, but only if it is paid for within seven days under specified conditions.\n\nAmends Rule XXV to repeal the permission for Members of the House to accept gifts of a nominal value.\n\nDeems a gift any payments or disbursements for an event in honor of a Member, officer, or employee that is held at a national party convention.\n\n\n\nAmends the Rules of the House to consider as gifts reimbursements to Members, officers, and employees for official travel-related expenses from nongovernmental organizations that retain or employ registered lobbyists or agents of a foreign principal.\n\nProhibits such individuals from accepting transportation or lodging on trips arranged or financed by a lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal, or in which a lobbyist participates.\n\nSets forth reporting requirements for lobbyist campaign contributions.\n\nAmends the federal criminal code to impose a two-year moratorium on lobbying of Congress by former Members, officers, or employees.\n\nEstablishes within the legislative branch the Office of Public Integrity."
