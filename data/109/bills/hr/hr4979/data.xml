  <summary>4/20/2006--Public Law.
Local Community Recovery Act of 2006 - Amends Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act provisions requiring giving preference in the expenditure of federal funds for major disaster or emergency assistance activities to local organizations, firms, or individuals to permit a contract or agreement for such activities to be set aside for award based on a specific geographic area.

Urges the Corps of Engineers to promptly implement the Government Accountability Office (GAO) decision in a solicitation dated March 20, 2006, that such Act allows for geographic preferences.</summary>
