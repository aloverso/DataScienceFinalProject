Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2006 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill or resolution (or related amendment, motion, or conference report) that would cause spending for non-defense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending for the budget year to exceed the amount of spending for such activities in FY2007.

Permits waiver or suspension of such provisions only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Senate. Requires an affirmative vote of three-fifths also for appeals in the Senate of rulings of the Chair.</summary>
