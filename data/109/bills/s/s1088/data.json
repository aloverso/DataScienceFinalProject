Requires unexhausted claims to be dismissed with prejudice.\n\nLimits the ability of habeas corpus petitioners to amend petitions or modify or add additional claims.\n\nRequires any period in which a petitioner does not have a habeas corpus petition pending in a state court to be charged against the one year limitation period for filing a federal habeas corpus petition from a state court decision.\n\nRequires requests for financial support for petitioners in a habeas corpus proceeding to be decided by a judge other than the judge presiding over such proceeding. Requires any amount of financial support authorized by a judge to be publicly disclosed.\n\nExtends crime victims' rights to federal habeas corpus proceedings arising out of a state conviction."
