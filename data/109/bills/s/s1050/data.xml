  <summary>5/17/2005--Introduced.
Expedited Remedy for Persistent Dumping Act of 2005 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to revise requirements for monitoring cases of suspected persistent dumping to: (1) provide for an expedited antidumping investigation of merchandise from an additional supplier country if the Department of Commerce discerns imports of merchandise from the additional supplier country have increased by 15 percent or more during a period of 90 days or longer; and (2) establish Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission procedures and deadlines for making determinations as to whether or not dumping and injury have occurred.

Adds specific conditions for reducing the price used to establish export price or "constructed export price," meaning the amount at which the merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold in the United States by or for the producer or exporter.

Applies this Act to Canada and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.</summary>
