  <summary>7/12/2005--Public Law.
Amends title VI (Open-market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act or ORBIT Act) of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962, concerning INTELSAT (a global satellite provider of voice, data, and Internet services) and Inmarsat (a global mobile satellite communications provider), to prohibit any successor entity or separated entity from having officers or managers who are officers or managers of any signatories. (Current law prohibits any successor entity or separated entity from having officers or managers who are officers or managers of any signatories or former signatories or who have any direct financial interest in or financial relationship to any signatories or former signatories, except that such interest may be managed through a blind trust or similar mechanism.) Strikes provsions that prohibited a separated entity from having officers or directors, who are either officers or managers of any intergovernmental organization or who have any direct financial interest in or financial relationship to any international organization, except that such interest may be managed through a blind trust or similar mechanism.

Requires the United States to preserve the space segment capacity of the GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System).

Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to review competitive market conditions of domestic and international satellite communications services and include in an annual report an analysis of those conditions.</summary>
