  <summary>3/13/2006--Passed Senate without amendment.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) it is time for Bosnia and Herzegovina to work toward creation of a state with more self-sustaining institutions; (2) any agreement on constitutional reform should advance the principles of democracy and tolerance, and bring the country closer to European Union (EU) membership; (3) the United States supports the development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a unified, democratic state on the path toward Euro-Atlantic integration; (4) all parties to negotiations on the reforms of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina should work together so that a first set of revisions to the Constitution can take effect before national elections in October 2006; (5) all groups responsible for past violence and atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina must accept responsibility for their actions and promote reconciliation; and (6) all levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina must comply with the directives of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), arrest persons indicted for war crimes, and turn over fugitives to face justice at the International Criminal Tribunal.</summary>
