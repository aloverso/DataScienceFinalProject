  <summary>10/18/2005--Passed Senate without amendment.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) rebirthing, an attachment therapy technique that reenacts the birth process by physically restraining a child and forcing the child to emerge unaided, is dangerous, potentially life-threatening, and unsupported by scientific evidence; and (2) each state should enact laws prohibiting the use of rebirthing techniques.</summary>
