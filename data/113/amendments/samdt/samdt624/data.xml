  <description>To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to restore families' health care flexibility by repealing the $2,500 federal cap on flexible spending accounts and the requirement that individuals obtain a prescription from a physician before purchasing over-the-counter drugs with their own flexible spending account or health savings account dollars in order to safeguard families' capacity to plan ahead for the rising cost of care, make their own health care decisions, and ensure children who have special needs can receive adequate care.</description>
