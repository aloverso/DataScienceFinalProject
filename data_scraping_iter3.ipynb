    "# Summary\n",
    "This notebook, in its third iteration, was used to take all of the individual JSON files we had downloaded from GovTrack onto an external hard drive and convert them for each body of Congress in each session into an individual .csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in this .csv file consisted of each member of that house, the date of the vote, whether or note the vote was on an amendment to a bill, as opposed to a bill itself, the amount of that body that is required for the vote to succeed, the result of the vote, and the title of the bill which is used to find the bill JSON file later. The rows of this .csv file are each a record of a vote that occurred in that legislative body for that session. Since we break up by body, we produce from, for example the 103rd Congress, [103house.csv](https://github.com/dinopants174/DataScienceFinalProject/blob/gh-pages/data/congress_sessions_legislation/103house.csv) and [103senate.csv](https://github.com/dinopants174/DataScienceFinalProject/blob/gh-pages/data/congress_sessions_legislation/103senate.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "We record whether or not a vote is for an amendment to a bill or to a bill itself because later, when we try and find what legislation a given vote actually concerns, we cannot find the subjects a particular amendment refers to, only the subjects that the bill the amendment amends refers to. So what we do is essentially a double counting in that we say that every amendment to a bill concerns the same subjects that that bill concerns. This means that are essentially saying bills with more amendments count as more votes on those bill's subjects."
